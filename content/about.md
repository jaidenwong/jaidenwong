Hi, my name is Jaiden Wong! I'm a recent graduate of the University of Oregon ('21) with a BA in journalism (advertising) and a minor in entrepreneurship.

I'm not afraid to ask questions when I don't understand something and I'll never pretend like I know more than I do. I'm here to learn and I'm a quick learner. I take criticism with grace and am not afraid to pivot to please the client. I communicate well with others and I like to do so frequently to prevent miscommunication. I work well collaboratively and independently and have experience doing both.

I'm skilled at social media marketing, digital marketing, brand strategy/alignment, customer relationship management, public relations, advertising, content creation/strategy, etc.
